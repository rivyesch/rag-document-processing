Many of the forward-looking statements are \nlocated in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition \nand Results of Operations.” Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain \nassumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in \nthis Form 10-K regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of \noperations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” \n“anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and \nsimilar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may \ndiffer significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences \ninclude, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The \nCompany assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.', 'Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 29\n\nApple Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions)\nYears ended\nSeptember 25,\n2021\nSeptember 26,\n2020\nSeptember 28,\n2019\nNet income $ 94,680 $ 57,411 $ 55,256 \nOther comprehensive income/(loss):\nChange in foreign currency translation, net of tax  501  88  (408) \nChange in unrealized gains/losses on derivative instruments, net of tax:\nChange in fair value of derivative instruments  32  79  (661) \nAdjustment for net (gains)/losses realized and included in net \nincome  1,003  (1,264)  23 \nTotal change in unrealized gains/losses on derivative \ninstruments  1,035  (1,185)  (638) \nChange in unrealized gains/losses on marketable debt securities, net of \ntax:\nChange in fair value of marketable debt securities  (694)  1,202  3,802 \nAdjustment for net (gains)/losses realized and included in net \nincome  (273)  (63)  25 \nTotal change in unrealized gains/losses on marketable debt \nsecurities  (967)  1,139  3,827 \nTotal other comprehensive income/(loss)  569  42  2,781 \nTotal comprehensive income $ 95,249 $ 57,453 $ 58,037 \nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 30\n\nApple Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except number of shares which are reflected in thousands and par value)\nSeptember 25,\n2021\nSeptember 26,\n2020\nASSETS:\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 34,940 $ 38,016 \nMarketable securities  27,699  52,927 \nAccounts receivable, net  26,278  16,120 \nInventories  6,580  4,061 \nVendor non-trade receivables  25,228  21,325 \nOther current assets  14,111  11,264 \nTotal current assets  134,836  143,713 \nNon-current assets:\nMarketable securities  127,877  100,887 \nProperty, plant and equipment, net  39,440  36,766 \nOther non-current assets  48,849  42,522 \nTotal non-current assets  216,166  180,175 \nTotal assets $ 351,002 $ 323,888 \nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 54,763 $ 42,296 \nOther current liabilities  47,493  42,684 \nDeferred revenue  7,612  6,643 \nCommercial paper  6,000  4,996 \nTerm debt  9,613  8,773 \nTotal current liabilities  125,481  105,392 \nNon-current liabilities:\nTerm debt  109,106  98,667 \nOther non-current liabilities  53,325  54,490 \nTotal non-current liabilities  162,431  153,157 \nTotal liabilities  287,912  258,549 \nCommitments and contingencies\nShareholders’ equity:\nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital, $0.00001 par value: 50,400,000 shares \nauthorized;

The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global \neconomic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.

The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a \nguarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the \nguarantee liability recognized within net sales.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the \nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \nAsia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services \n(“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for \ncontent creation, Internet and telecommunications services and supplier arrangements. Future payments under noncancelable \nunconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September\xa025, 2021, are as follows (in \nmillions):\n2022 $ 4,551 \n2023  2,165 \n2024  984 \n2025  405 \n2026  51 \nThereafter  28 \nTotal $ 8,184 \nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 48\n\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that \nhave not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim \nis probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or \nmore legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the \nCompany’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the \nopinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a \nmaterial loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the \nfollowing matters:\nVirnetX\nVirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents \nowned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”).

The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, \nsmall and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its \ndirect sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network \ncarriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2021, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution \nchannels accounted for 36% and 64%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price \ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short \nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid \nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of \nthe Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating \nthe Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative \nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for \nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal \ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative \nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and \naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 2\n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables \nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have \nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings \nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products \nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut \nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products \nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for \nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition \nas competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated \nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the \nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \nAsia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s \nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \nservices and technologies to the marketplace.', 'The remaining $60.9 billion  in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the Program as of \nSeptember\xa0 25, 2021.

For example, \nthe gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross \nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global \nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased \ncompetition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product \nlife cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and \ndelivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; \nshifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory \nchanges require the Company to modify its product and service offering s; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the \nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors \ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a \ndecline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to \nunexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new \nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the \nCompany’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative \nto local currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated \nsales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on \nproducts that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency \nexchange rate fluctuations.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 15\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign \ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing \ndemand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to \nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross \nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign \ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its \nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may \nincrease the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to \nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more \nthan a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the \nhedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and \neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of \nthe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, \nalthough the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable \nsecurities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the \nCompany’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments \nrelated to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.', 'These and other economic \nfactors can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other  international disputes, war, terrorism, \nnatural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents \nand other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material \nadverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular \nnetwork carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international \ntrade. Trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade \nand can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of \ntariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost \nof the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely \nimpact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive \nfor customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also \nadopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the \nCompany’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These \nmeasures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, \nand ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or \nchanged trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to \nmanagement. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to \neffectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding t rade and other  international \ndisputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s \nbusiness.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract \nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and \nfacilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial \naccidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health \nissues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate \nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can \nmake it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and \ninefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service \nofferings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant \nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the \nsupply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any \nnegative consequences to the Company.\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While \nthe Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur \nand could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, \nincluding pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the \nCompany due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public \nsafety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products \nbetween regions; and disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of \nthe supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to \ncover all losses that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 7\n\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological \nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.', 'The Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity \nrequirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and \nachieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of \nminimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment \ngrade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk \nassociated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a \nchange in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield \ncurve. Based on investment positions as of September\xa0 25, 2021 and September\xa0 26, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point \nincrease in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market \nvalue of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\nAs of September\xa025, 2021  and September\xa026, 2020 , the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying \nmaturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $118.7 billion and $107.4 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in \nthe future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow \nthe Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate \npayments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging \ninstrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of \nSeptember\xa025, 2021 and September\xa026, 2020 to increase by $186 million and $218 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and \nin particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in \nU.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there \nhas been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign \nexchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future \ncash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into \nforeign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated \ndebt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue \nand inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign \nexchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic \ncost of hedging particular exposures.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 26\n\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative \npositions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of \nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random \nmarket price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given \nconfidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model \nis not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm \ncommitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of \nthe model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of \nSeptember\xa025, 2021, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September\xa026, 2020. Because the \nCompany uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are \ngenerally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.', 'Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory \napprovals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from \ncompleting a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These \nnew ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.

The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain \nstores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique \ndesign elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail \nstores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor \nperformance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and \nseverance costs.\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the \nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse \neffect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store \nconstruction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the \nvalue of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable \nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary \ncourse of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements \nentered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and \ndamages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government \ninvestigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, \nhas generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and \nnew claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents \nand seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual \nproperty rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as \ninternationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be \nexpensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management.

In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete \nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on \nits\xa0 intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the \nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if \ncompetitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be \nadversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces \nsubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other \nresources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the \nCompany’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. \nCompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain \ncompetitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of \nthe markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications \nwithin their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.

Trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade \nand can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of \ntariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost \nof the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely \nimpact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products.

For example, \nthe gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross \nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global \nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased \ncompetition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product \nlife cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and \ndelivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; \nshifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory \nchanges require the Company to modify its product and service offering s; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the \nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors \ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \npart to seasonal holiday demand.

Competitors frequently introduce new products and services rapidly, often with short product life cycles and evolving industry standards. Many competitors compete primarily through aggressive pricing, low cost structures, and by imitating Apple's products and infringing on its intellectual property. Some competitors have broader product lines, offer lower-priced products, and have larger installed bases of active devices. Competition is further intensified as rivals collaborate to offer integrated solutions or imitate Apple's approach to seamless component integration. Additionally, Apple's services compete with business models that provide free content and with illegitimate means of obtaining third-party digital content and applications. These competitive pressures may affect Apple's ability to maintain its functional and design advantages, successfully introduce innovative new products and services, and sustain attractive profit margins.","Aggressive price competition, short product life cycles, rapid adoption of technology by competitors, and imitation of Apple’s products.",0.94999999997625,1.0,1.0,0.9999985112418918

The Company has \nimplemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no \nassurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies \nand procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the \nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that \nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may \nnot be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory \nscrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. \nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market \nand legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the \nproposed EU Digital Markets Act, could, if enacted, require further changes. These changes could include how and to what \nextent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in \nlegal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact \non the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of \ninvestigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse \nfindings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its \nApp Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial \ncondition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s \nbusiness practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become \nsubject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could adversely affect the Company’s \ncommercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of \noperations and financial condition.', 'Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory \napprovals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from \ncompleting a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These \nnew ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could adversely affect the \nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of \nresources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information \nsystems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain \nstores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique \ndesign elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail \nstores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor \nperformance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and \nseverance costs.\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the \nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse \neffect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store \nconstruction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the \nvalue of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable \nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary \ncourse of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements \nentered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and \ndamages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government \ninvestigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, \nhas generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and \nnew claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents \nand seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual \nproperty rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as \ninternationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be \nexpensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these \nconsiderations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. \nThere can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These \nagreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to \nchange its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form \n10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading \n“Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a \nmaterial loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other \nclaims.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 13\n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against \nthe Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s \nresults of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.']","Antitrust investigations pose several potential impacts to Apple's business, including the risk of significant fines and the requirement to make changes to its App Store business practices. Such investigations can result in legal proceedings and claims that may materially adversely affect the company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, these investigations could lead to changes in how Apple charges developers for access to its platforms and manages app distribution, potentially limiting its business operations and affecting its revenue.

The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global \neconomic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the \nmeasures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, \nresults of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock.\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the \nCompany’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number \nof the Company’s employees working remotely.

For example, \nthe gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross \nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global \nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased \ncompetition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product \nlife cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and \ndelivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; \nshifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory \nchanges require the Company to modify its product and service offering s; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the \nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors \ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a \ndecline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to \nunexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new \nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the \nCompany’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative \nto local currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated \nsales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on \nproducts that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency \nexchange rate fluctuations.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 15\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign \ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing \ndemand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to \nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross \nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign \ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its \nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may \nincrease the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to \nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more \nthan a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the \nhedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and \neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of \nthe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, \nalthough the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable \nsecurities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the \nCompany’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments \nrelated to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.', 'Rest of Asia Pacific\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, iPad and \nServices.

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.', 'Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \nAsia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s \nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing \nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of \nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, \naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of \nintellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such \nintellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the \nCompany relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is \ncurrently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio \nof issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain \naspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s \nproducts. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its \nproducts.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include \nintellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various \naspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such \nlicenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future \non reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 3\n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect \ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated, and dedicated team, and is committed to supporting the development of all \nof its team members and to continuously building on its strong culture. As of September\xa0 25, 2021 , the Company had \napproximately 154,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is committed to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, \nsexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, veteran status, caste or other legally protected characteristic. The \nCompany is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should not only be competitive; it should be equitable and should enable employees \nto share in the Company’s success as shareholders of the Company. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to \nthrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal \nlives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits to employees around the world.\nGrowth and Development\nThe Company invests in tools and resources that support employees’ individual growth and development. The Company also \nprovides classes and seminars to foster understanding and critical thinking about the Company’s culture, organization and \nvalues.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company is committed to hiring inclusively, providing training and development opportunities, fostering an inclusive culture, \nand ensuring equitable pay for employees, and is continuing to focus on increasing diverse representation at every level of the \nCompany.\nThe Company has initiatives in place to implement its commitment to increase diverse representation, including creating diverse \ninterview panels and candidate slates, focusing on robust diversity recruiting efforts, and expanding diversity outreach efforts \nthrough organizations that serve and engage talent from underrepresented communities.']",Empty Response,$21.9 billion.,0.0,0.0,,0.0

The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global \neconomic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the \nmeasures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, \nresults of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock.\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the \nCompany’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number \nof the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other \nfacilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it \ncontinues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth \nquarter of 2021, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting \nin supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.\nThe extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is \nuncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of \nthe pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availabilit y, distribution and effectiveness of  vaccines and \ntreatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures , and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and \ndemand for consumer products.

The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global \neconomic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the \nmeasures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, \nresults of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock.\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the \nCompany’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number \nof the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other \nfacilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it \ncontinues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth \nquarter of 2021, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting \nin supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.\nThe extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is \nuncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of \nthe pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availabilit y, distribution and effectiveness of  vaccines and \ntreatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures , and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and \ndemand for consumer products.

The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit \nexposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. \nHowever, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, \naccounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the \nhedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, \noption contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally \nhedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to \n12 months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency \nexchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company \ndesignates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September\xa025, 2021, the Company’s hedged term \ndebt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 21 years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins \nfrom certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains \nand losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into \ninterest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value \nhedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September\xa025, 2021 and September\xa026, 2020 \nwere as follows (in millions):\n2021 2020\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts $ 76,475 $ 57,410 \nInterest rate contracts $ 16,875 $ 20,700 \nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts $ 126,918 $ 88,636 \nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of September\xa0 25, 2021  and \nSeptember\xa026, 2020.\nThe gains and losses recognized in OCI and amounts reclassified from AOCI to net income for the Company’s derivative \ninstruments designated as cash flow hedges were not material in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 39\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September\xa025, 2021 and September\xa026, 2020 \nwere as follows (in millions):\n2021 2020\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities $ 15,954 $ 16,270 \nCurrent and non-current term debt $ (17,857) $ (21,033) \nThe gains and losses on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged item \nadjustments were not material in 2021, 2020 and 2019.', 'Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 29\n\nApple Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions)\nYears ended\nSeptember 25,\n2021\nSeptember 26,\n2020\nSeptember 28,\n2019\nNet income $ 94,680 $ 57,411 $ 55,256 \nOther comprehensive income/(loss):\nChange in foreign currency translation, net of tax  501  88  (408) \nChange in unrealized gains/losses on derivative instruments, net of tax:\nChange in fair value of derivative instruments  32  79  (661) \nAdjustment for net (gains)/losses realized and included in net \nincome  1,003  (1,264)  23 \nTotal change in unrealized gains/losses on derivative \ninstruments  1,035  (1,185)  (638) \nChange in unrealized gains/losses on marketable debt securities, net of \ntax:\nChange in fair value of marketable debt securities  (694)  1,202  3,802 \nAdjustment for net (gains)/losses realized and included in net \nincome  (273)  (63)  25 \nTotal change in unrealized gains/losses on marketable debt \nsecurities  (967)  1,139  3,827 \nTotal other comprehensive income/(loss)  569  42  2,781 \nTotal comprehensive income $ 95,249 $ 57,453 $ 58,037 \nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 30\n\nApple Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except number of shares which are reflected in thousands and par value)\nSeptember 25,\n2021\nSeptember 26,\n2020\nASSETS:\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 34,940 $ 38,016 \nMarketable securities  27,699  52,927 \nAccounts receivable, net  26,278  16,120 \nInventories  6,580  4,061 \nVendor non-trade receivables  25,228  21,325 \nOther current assets  14,111  11,264 \nTotal current assets  134,836  143,713 \nNon-current assets:\nMarketable securities  127,877  100,887 \nProperty, plant and equipment, net  39,440  36,766 \nOther non-current assets  48,849  42,522 \nTotal non-current assets  216,166  180,175 \nTotal assets $ 351,002 $ 323,888 \nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 54,763 $ 42,296 \nOther current liabilities  47,493  42,684 \nDeferred revenue  7,612  6,643 \nCommercial paper  6,000  4,996 \nTerm debt  9,613  8,773 \nTotal current liabilities  125,481  105,392 \nNon-current liabilities:\nTerm debt  109,106  98,667 \nOther non-current liabilities  53,325  54,490 \nTotal non-current liabilities  162,431  153,157 \nTotal liabilities  287,912  258,549 \nCommitments and contingencies\nShareholders’ equity:\nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital, $0.00001 par value: 50,400,000 shares \nauthorized; 16,426,786 and 16,976,763 shares issued and outstanding, respectively  57,365  50,779 \nRetained earnings  5,562  14,966 \nAccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)  163  (406) \nTotal shareholders’ equity  63,090  65,339 \nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 351,002 $ 323,888 \nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 31\n\nApple Inc.']","In 2021, Apple reported cash and cash equivalents of $34,940 million, current marketable securities of $27,699 million, and non-current marketable securities of $127,877 million.",$191.8 billion.,0.7555555555303703,0.0,1.0,0.9750563669720508

The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global \neconomic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the \nmeasures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, \nresults of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock.\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the \nCompany’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number \nof the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other \nfacilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it \ncontinues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth \nquarter of 2021, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting \nin supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.\nThe extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is \nuncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of \nthe pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availabilit y, distribution and effectiveness of  vaccines and \ntreatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures , and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and \ndemand for consumer products.

The Company has reopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other \nfacilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it \ncontinues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth \nquarter of 2021, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting \nin supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.\nThe extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is \nuncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of \nthe pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availabilit y, distribution and effectiveness of  vaccines and \ntreatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures , and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and \ndemand for consumer products.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the \nmeasures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, \nresults of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock.\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the \nCompany’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number \nof the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other \nfacilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it \ncontinues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth \nquarter of 2021, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting \nin supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.\nThe extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is \nuncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of \nthe pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availabilit y, distribution and effectiveness of  vaccines and \ntreatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures , and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and \ndemand for consumer products.

The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global \neconomic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.', 'dollar–denominated fixed- or floating-rate notes, the Company has entered into \ninterest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates or the floating interest rates to fixed \ninterest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency–\ndenominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar–\ndenominated notes.\nThe effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if \napplicable, adjustments related to hedging.

RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan \ngenerally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s \ncommon stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under \nthe plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding \nobligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of \nRSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which \nentitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock.

Which accounting standard governs Apple’s financial statements?,"['Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 33\n\nApple Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” \nor the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s \nmanagement, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary \nfor fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in \nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that \naffect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the \nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s \npresentation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is \nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The \nCompany’s fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, \nquarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and \nperiods of those fiscal years.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses\nAt the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) \nAccounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit \nLosses on Financial Instruments  (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain \nfinancial instruments. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of \nASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on \nthe date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. \nFurther information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (net income in \nmillions and shares in thousands):\n2021 2020 2019\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 94,680 $ 57,411 $ 55,256 \nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares outstanding  16,701,272  17,352,119  18,471,336 \nEffect of dilutive securities  163,647  176,095  124,315 \nWeighted-average diluted shares  16,864,919  17,528,214  18,595,651 \nBasic earnings per share $ 5.67 $ 3.31 $ 2.99 \nDiluted earnings per share $ 5.61 $ 3.28 $ 2.97 \nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 34\n\nThe Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities.  Potentially \ndilutive securities representing 62 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per \nshare for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.\nThe Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The \nCompany classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying \ncontractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are \nrecognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”). \nThe Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their \navailability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and \nlosses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”).\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.', 'In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at \nSeptember\xa025, 2021 and September\xa026, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in \nthe period ended September\xa025, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the \n“PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September\xa0 25, 2021, based on criteria established in  \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission \n(2013 framework) and our report dated October\xa028, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on \nApple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are \nrequired to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules \nand regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to \nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial \nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included \nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included \nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall \npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was \ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\xa0relates to accounts or disclosures that are \nmaterial to the financial statements and (2)\xa0 involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The \ncommunication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, \nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on \nthe account or disclosure to which it relates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nDescription of the Matter As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files \nincome tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. \nAs of September\xa025, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.5 \nbillion, of which $6.6 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. Apple \nInc. uses significant judgment in the calculation of tax liabilities in estimating the impact of \nuncertainties in the application of technical merits and complex tax laws.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than \nnot to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be \ncomplex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal \nrulings.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 52\n\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls \nover management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be \nsustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the \ndevelopment of the related disclosures.\nTo evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be \nsustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating \nmanagement’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications \nwith taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax \npositions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of \ncertain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and \nexperience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received \nexternal legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors \nand Apple Inc. tax personnel.', 'The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their \navailability for use in current operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and \nlosses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”).\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, \nwhich for buildings is the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years for machinery and \nequipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for \nleasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the \nestimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to seven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property \nand equipment was $9.5 billion, $9.7 billion and $11.3 billion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNoncash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net decrease to accounts payable and other \ncurrent liabilities of $2.9 billion during 2019.\nRestricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities\nThe Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The \nCompany reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current \nclassification based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current \nor non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative \ngains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred \nin accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged \ntransaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as \ncash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a \nstraight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. \nChanges in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in \nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to \nthe change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company \nexcludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in OI&E on a straight-line \nbasis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are \nrecognized in OCI.\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges \nare recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate.\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 35\n\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The \nCompany classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash \nFlows.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in \nactive markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments \nand all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market \nprices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nNote 2 – Revenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue \nat the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is \ngenerally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of \nownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control \ntransfers when products are shipped.
