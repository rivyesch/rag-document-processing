What are two macroeconomic risks identified by Apple?,"['## Macroeconomic and Industry Risks', ""## The  Company's  operations  and  performance  depend  significantly  on  global  and  regional  economic  conditions  and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales. In addition, the Company's global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company's supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can  materially  adversely  affect  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services.  In  addition,  consumer  confidence  and spending can be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company's products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic  conditions  can  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  Company's  suppliers,  contract  manufacturers,  logistics  providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company's products; and insolvency.\n\nA  downturn  in  the  economic  environment  can  also  lead  to  increased  credit  and  collectibility  risk  on  the  Company's  trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company's ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company's financial instruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition."", ""## The  Company's  business  can  be  impacted  by  political  events,  trade  and  other  international  disputes,  war,  terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company's business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed  trade  restrictions  can  be  expensive,  time-consuming,  disruptive  to  the  Company's  operations  and  distracting  to management.  Such  restrictions  can  be  announced  with  little  or  no  advance  notice  and  the  Company  may  not  be  able  to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers,  are  in  locations  that  are  prone  to  earthquakes  and  other  natural  disasters.  In  addition,  such  operations  and facilities  are  subject  to  the  risk  of  interruption  by  fire,  power  shortages,  nuclear  power  plant  accidents  and  other  industrial accidents,  terrorist  attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make  it  difficult  or  impossible  for  the  Company  to  manufacture  and  deliver  products  to  its  customers,  create  delays  and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical  components,  a  business  interruption  affecting  such  sources  would  exacerbate  any negative consequences to the Company.\n\nThe Company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company's business and harm to the Company's reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company's supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise."", ""## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nThe Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company's stock, can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more  of  these  risks  materialize  from  time  to  time,  the  Company's  business,  reputation,  results  of  operations  and  financial condition, as well as the price of the Company's stock, can be materially and adversely affected.\n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use  historical  trends  to  anticipate  results  or  trends  in  future  periods.

Gross margins on the Company's products in foreign countries and on products  that  include  components  obtained  from  foreign  suppliers  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  foreign  currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar's strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.\n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign  currency  derivative  instruments,  thereby  limiting  the  benefit.  Additionally,  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  may increase the Company's cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.""]","Two macroeconomic risks identified include adverse economic conditions such as inflation, slower growth or recession, and currency fluctuations that can materially affect demand for products and services.

For  example,  the  global  semiconductor  industry  is  experiencing  high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company's ability to obtain sufficient  quantities  of  components  and  products  on  commercially  reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company's ability to obtain sufficient  quantities  of  components  on  commercially  reasonable  terms  or  at  all.  The  effects  of  global  or  regional  economic conditions  on  the  Company's  suppliers,  described  in  ' The  Company's  operations  and  performance  depend  significantly  on global  and  regional  economic  conditions  and  adverse  economic  conditions  can  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company's business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition, '  above,  can  also  affect  the  Company's  ability  to  obtain  components . Therefore,  the  Company  remains  subject  to  significant  risks  of  supply  shortages  and  price  increases  that  can  materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses  new  technologies,  initial  capacity  constraints  may  exist  until  the  suppliers'  yields  have  matured  or  their  manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. When the Company's supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company's business and  financial  performance  could  also  be  materially  adversely  affected  depending  on  the  time  required  to  obtain  sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.""]","Apple faces several risks from global competition, including aggressive price competition that puts downward pressure on gross margins, rapid technological changes requiring continual innovation, and short product life cycles. Competitors often introduce new products and services frequently, adopt technological advancements quickly, and compete through lower prices and cost structures. Some competitors may offer products at little or no profit or even at a loss, intensifying competition. Additionally, Apple faces risks from competitors imitating its product features and infringing on its intellectual property, which may be inadequately protected in some countries. The company also competes against business models that provide free content or use illegitimate means to obtain digital content. These factors can adversely affect Apple's ability to maintain a competitive advantage, market share, and profitability in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet, wearables, accessories, and services markets.","Aggressive price competition, short product life cycles, rapid adoption of technology by competitors, and imitation of Apple’s products.",0.9999999999666667,1.0,1.0,1.0

What potential impacts do antitrust investigations pose to Apple’s business?,"[""## The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the proposed EU Digital Markets Act, could,  if  enacted,  require  further  changes.  These  changes  could  include  how  and  to  what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.\n\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on  the  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  For  example,  the  Company  is  the  subject  of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company's business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\n\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject  to  investigations  and  litigation  that,  if  resolved  against  those  other  companies,  could  adversely  affect  the  Company's commercial  relationships  with  those  business  partners  and  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company's  business,  results  of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company's platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\n\nThere can be no assurance the Company's business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the  outcomes  of  such  investigations,  litigation  or  changes  to  laws  and  regulations  in  the  future.  Changes  to  the  Company's business  practices  to  comply  with  new  laws  and  regulations  or  in  connection  with  other  legal  proceedings  could  negatively impact the reputation of the Company's products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales."", ""## The  Company's  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  could  be  adversely  impacted  by  unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.\n\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course  of  business  and  have  not  yet  been  fully  resolved,  and  new  matters  may  arise  in  the  future.  In  addition,  agreements entered  into  by  the  Company  sometimes  include  indemnification  provisions  which  can  subject  the  Company  to  costs  and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property  rights.  The  Company  is  vigorously  defending  infringement  actions  in  courts  in  several  U.S.  jurisdictions,  as  well  as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\n\nRegardless  of  the  merit  of  particular  claims,  defending  against  litigation  or  responding  to  government  investigations  can  be expensive,  time-consuming,  disruptive  to  the  Company's  operations  and  distracting  to  management.  In  recognition  of  these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There  can  be  no  assurance  such  agreements  can  be  obtained  on  acceptable  terms  or  that  litigation  will  not  occur.  These agreements can also significantly increase the Company's cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company's ability to offer certain products and services.\n\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading 'Legal Proceedings' and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K  in  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Note  10,  'Commitments  and  Contingencies'  under  the  heading 'Contingencies,' in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material  loss,  or  a  material  loss  greater  than  a  recorded  accrual,  concerning  loss  contingencies  for  asserted  legal  and  other claims.\n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the Company's results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  for  that  reporting  period  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.  Further,  such  an outcome  can  result  in  significant  compensatory,  punitive  or  trebled  monetary  damages,  disgorgement  of  revenue  or  profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company's ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.""]","Antitrust investigations could lead to legal proceedings and claims that may have a materially adverse impact on the business, results of operations, and financial condition. If investigations result in adverse findings, the company could face significant fines and be required to make changes to its App Store business. Such changes could materially adversely affect the business, including how the company charges developers and manages app distribution. Additionally, these investigations may necessitate alterations to business practices, potentially harming the company's reputation for privacy and security, reducing competitive advantage, leading to poor market acceptance, decreased demand for products and services, and lost sales.","They could result in fines, mandatory changes to the App Store, reputational harm, and adverse impacts on sales and margins.",0.99999999995,1.0,1.0,0.0
"Which quarter has historically seen higher net sales for Apple, and why?","[""## Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand.

The  timing  of  product  introductions  can  also  impact  the  Company's  net  sales  to  its  indirect distribution  channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches.

Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in  which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses  such  as  research  and  development,  corporate  marketing  expenses,  certain  share-based  compensation  expenses, income  taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.
